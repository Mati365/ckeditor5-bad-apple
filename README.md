Because who *wouldn't* want to embed a full ASCII animation directly inside a WYSIWYG editor?  
CKEditor 5 handles *Bad Apple* so smoothly it makes other editors struggle with rendering bold text.  
Perfect for showing off speed, absurdity and complete disregard for what ‚Äúserious software‚Äù should do.
