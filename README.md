Ever looked at a table and thought, *‚ÄúYep, that‚Äôs the perfect place to run a monochrome anime MV at 30 FPS‚Äù*? No? Well, too late. I did it anyway. CKEditor 5 now politely ignores all notions of sane use-cases and slam-dunks **Bad Apple** straight into a `<tbody>` like it‚Äôs trying to break your GPU out of spite. Hundreds of `<td>`s blink on and off in synchronized agony, forming a glorious crime against productivity. Absolutely zero real-world justification. Maximum commitment to bit-crushing silliness. Yes, it works.
